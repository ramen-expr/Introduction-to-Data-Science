### Introduction to Unit
Course material is found in lectures and tutorials.

*Recommended Readings*:
"R for Data Science" by Garrett Grolemund is a good textbook to study too
"Practical Data Science with R 2nd Edition" by Nina Zumel and John Mount as well

***Course recommendation:*** Back up your work. Please.
Reading List has the textbooks needed/recommended. I have downloaded them in the "Textbooks" folder.

### What is Data Science?
Data Science is the science that encapsulates several components to turn raw data
into actionable insights or meaningful information

It is a rapidly evolving space so you need to be up to date on the evolving technologies. 

One of these that we use is R. It is an object-oriented language, geared towards statistics.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**
- Data Science encapsulates different disciplines to extract insights from messy data
- Data science is not just statistics, it is more about understanding the interests and the needs of the stakeholders
- As a data scientist you need to be equipped with the passion to understand different problems from different domains 
- Data science is quite exciting if you are passionate about discovering root causes of the issues and ready to solve them
- Hands-on skill with R language is required for being a data scientist

### Actions
- [x]  [Check the curated list of the R videos ](https://unicanberra.instructure.com/courses/15626/pages/basics-of-r-language)
	- Found a playlist for R tutorials that are less R-Studio focused within that list of videos. [Click here to view.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al-pTT-YMEA&list=PLWPirh4EWFpEvN4ktS8LE0cvLCSfhD55t&index=3) 
- [x] [Ensure that you get yourself familiar with the steps to install R and R-Studio:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YmcEYTSN7k&ab_channel=RTutorials)
	- I have decided that on the office computer I will use command line and nvim to code in R, on the laptop I might use a mix on R-Studio or console 
- [x] There was some cool interactive learning module. Go back through lecture recording and check out the interactive modules
- [x] Check unit outline just to get a brief idea of what's required
- [x] Mark up the different assignments and weights on pieces of paper at home, so they can be crossed off as you go and see the due dates.
- [x] Set up git repo for this unit
- [x] Check out some of the textbooks.
