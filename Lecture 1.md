### What is Data Science?
Data Science is the science that encapsulates several components to turn raw data
into actionable insights or meaningful information

It is a rapidly evolving space so you need to be up to date on the evolving technologies. 

One of these that we use is R. It is an object-oriented language, geared towards statistics.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**
- Data Science encapsulates different disciplines to extract insights from messy data
- Data science is not just statistics, it is more about understanding the interests and the needs of the stakeholders
- As a data scientist you need to be equipped with the passion to understand different problems from different domains 
- Data science is quite exciting if you are passionate about discovering root causes of the issues and ready to solve them
- Hands-on skill with R language is required for being a data scientist
